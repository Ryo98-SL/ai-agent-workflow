# Workbench UI

React workbench UI package for editing workflows and running server-backed mock
runs through an injected workflow API.

```tsx
import { AppWorkbench } from "@ai-agent-workflow/workbench-ui";
import "@xyflow/react/dist/style.css";
import "@ai-agent-workflow/workbench-ui/styles.css";

<AppWorkbench workflowApi={client} />;
```

Consumers provide a workflow API compatible with
`@ai-agent-workflow/workflow-client`.
